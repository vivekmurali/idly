### ✅ What I Did
- Added memtable with redblacktree
- Added flush on Write when size is over some number

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How a memtable becomes an SSTable

### 🤔 Questions / Confusions
- How to determine size before flushing
- Who runs the flush? Is there a background process that's checking the size to see when to flush?

### 🔜 Next Steps
- Better file name for new SSTable
- Compaction
